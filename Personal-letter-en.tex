		Björn is a passionate developer with just over 3 years of experience in full-stack software development 
		both in larger teams and as an individual developer. He has worked and studied within many different systems, 
		including embedded systems and cloud-oriented systems.
		
		\vspace{10pt}
		During his studies at Blekinge Institute of Technology, he has studied the programming language C 
		and implemented and developed new algorithms. Both in his studies and in all the professional assignments 
		Björn has been involved in for a total of more than 5 years, he has used GIT on a daily basis. He has also used C 
		in projects related to Raspberry Pi and home automation with a strong focus on embedded systems. 
		During his time at CGI, he built a system to present transport times from Blekingetrafiken using Python. 
		Björn has used Python as a complement to many of his previous projects to handle and control, send, and receive information from various systems.
		
		\vspace{10pt}
		He is a person who is happy to talk and communicate with his team and is not afraid to take 
		initiative to solve problems that arise. Björn has a strong drive to learn and work with new technologies and systems, 
		which is the main reason he entered the software development and IT industry.
